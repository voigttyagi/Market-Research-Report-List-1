<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bi-Specific Antibodies Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fragment-Based Antibodies</li><li>IgG-Based Antibodies</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bi-specific antibodies therapy market comprises two primary types: fragment-based antibodies and IgG-based antibodies. Fragment-based antibodies are smaller constructs that target two antigens, offering improved tissue penetration and rapid clearance. They are often used for localized therapies. In contrast, IgG-based antibodies retain the full-length immunoglobulin structure, providing robust stability and longer circulation times in the bloodstream. This design enhances immune system engagement, making them suitable for a variety of therapeutic applications, including cancer treatment and autoimmune diseases.</p></p>
