<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OCT Imaging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time-Domain Type</li><li>Spectral-Domain Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OCT imaging system market consists of two main types: Time-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (TD-OCT) and Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). TD-OCT measures the time delay of reflected light to create images, offering lower resolution and slower scanning speeds. In contrast, SD-OCT utilizes spectral interference patterns to obtain images, providing higher resolution and faster capture rates. These differences make SD-OCT more favorable for applications requiring detailed imaging, thus influencing market demand and growth dynamics.</p></p>
